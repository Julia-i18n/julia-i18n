# julia-i18n

Central hub for internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of the [Julia language](http://julialang.org/) project.

## Goals and scope

This organization aims to cover **all things i18n and l10n in Julia** (colloquially referred to as translation),
including, but not limited to:

* The [official Julia website](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/julialang-web)
  and other relevant Julian websites, like the [package listing website](http://pkg.julialang.org/),
  [blogs](http://www.juliabloggers.com/), etc.
* The official Julia [documentation](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/),
  [open books](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia) and manuals,
  as well as other important sources of documentation
  such as [*StackOverflow Documentation*](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/julia-lang/topics),
  [*Learn Julia in Y minutes*](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/), and more,
  whenever and however possible.
* The documentation system in general,
  including the [documentation of Julia packages](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/297).
* Transcripts, captions (subtitles), titles and descriptions for
  [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage),
  [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsu0TcgLDUiIznEhN165XmykqyLgzwY0Y),
  [podcasts](http://www.rce-cast.com/Podcast/rce-107-julia.html), etc.
* And even the [i18n and l10n of the Julia language itself]
  (https://groups.google.com/d/topic/julia-dev/Vu6zyCPkkFs/discussion)!

If you happen to think Julia-i18n's objectives
are not [greedy enough](http://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia),
please submit an issue or pull request with your ungracious demands!
