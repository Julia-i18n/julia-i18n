# julia-i18n
Julia language internationalization and localization project.

## Objectives

As stated in [#1](https://github.com/Julia-i18n/julia-i18n/issues/1), the goal and scope of this organization is to cover **all things i18n and l10n in Julia** (numeronyms which stand for *internationalization* and *localization* respectively). This includes but is not limited to:

* i18n and l10n of the official Julia website and other relevant Julian websites, like the package listing website, blogs, etc.
* i18n and l10n of the official Julia [documentation](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/), [open books](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introducing_Julia) and manuals as well as other important sources of documentation like [*StackOverflow Documentation*](http://stackoverflow.com/documentation/julia-lang/topics), [*Learn Julia in Y minutes*](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/julia/), etc. whenever and however possible.
* i18n and l10n of the documentation system in general, including the [documentation of Julia packages](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl/issues/297), etc.
* i18n and l10n of transcripts, captions, etc. in [video lectures](https://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage) and [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nPmKG_f8-M&list=PLsu0TcgLDUiIznEhN165XmykqyLgzwY0Y), [podcasts](http://www.rce-cast.com/Podcast/rce-107-julia.html), etc.
* And even the i18n and l10n of [Julia itself](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-dev/Vu6zyCPkkFs).

If you happen to think Julia-i18n's objectives are not [greedy](http://julialang.org/blog/2012/02/why-we-created-julia), please send us a pull request with your ungracious demands!
